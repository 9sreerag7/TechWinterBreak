// Question 2: 
//Write a function that takes two numbers as parameters. If both are even, return their sum; if both are odd, return their difference 
//and if both are different return -1.

function sumOrDifference(num1, num2) {
  // Write code here
}

console.log(sumOrDifference(2, 4)); 
// Expected Output: 6 (Even sum)
console.log(sumOrDifference(3, 5)); 
// Expected Output: -2 (Odd difference)
console.log(sumOrDifference(2, 3)); 
// Expected Output: -1 (One even, one odd)
